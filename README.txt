A page for the outside user login/ score display board. 
A page for registering an account to actually play the game. MongoDB Database check-up?
Responsiveness for the Pancake to actually count the clicks.


Potentials:
A page that allows the user to get their forgotten user/password sent to their email if forgotten.
More responsiveness or additions to the Pancake clicker.
Listing the users with the highest scores on the scoreboard and having it displayed on the homepage and the pancake page.
